- **Average Price**: Mean ticket price across selected time period
- **Top Route**: Highest volume route by passenger count
- **Peak Season**: Season with highest demand percentage

## üîÑ Customization Options

### Adding Real Data Sources

To integrate with real APIs, modify the data fetching in \`app/page.tsx\`:

\`\`\`typescript
// Replace generateMockData() with real API calls
const fetchRealData = async () => {
  // Example: Amadeus API, Skyscanner API, etc.
  const response = await fetch('/api/real-airline-data')
  return response.json()
}
\`\`\`

### Modifying Routes and Cities

Update the routes array in \`generateMockData()\`:

\`\`\`typescript
const routes = [
  { from: "Your City", to: "Destination", code: "ABC-XYZ" },
  // Add more routes as needed
]
\`\`\`

### Customizing AI Insights

Modify the prompt in \`app/api/generate-insights/route.ts\` to focus on different business aspects:

\`\`\`typescript
const prompt = \`
Your custom analysis prompt here...
Focus on specific metrics or business questions...
\`
\`\`\`
