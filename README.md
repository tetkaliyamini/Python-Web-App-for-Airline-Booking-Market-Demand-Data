## üìä Understanding the Data

### Mock Data Structure
The application uses realistic mock data that simulates:

- **Australian Routes**: Major city pairs (Sydney-Melbourne, Brisbane-Gold Coast, etc.)
- **Booking Volumes**: Realistic passenger numbers and trends
- **Pricing Data**: Market-representative ticket prices
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Authentic Australian travel seasonality
- **Growth Metrics**: Route performance indicators

### Key Metrics Explained

- **Total Bookings**: Aggregate passenger volume across all routes
- **Average Price**: Mean ticket price across selected time period
- **Top Route**: Highest volume route by passenger count
- **Peak Season**: Season with highest demand percentage

## üîÑ Customization Options

### Adding Real Data Sources

To integrate with real APIs, modify the data fetching in \`app/page.tsx\`:

\`\`\`typescript
// Replace generateMockData() with real API calls
const fetchRealData = async () => {
  // Example: Amadeus API, Skyscanner API, etc.
  const response = await fetch('/api/real-airline-data')
  return response.json()
}
\`\`\`

### Modifying Routes and Cities

Update the routes array in \`generateMockData()\`:

\`\`\`typescript
const routes = [
  { from: "Your City", to: "Destination", code: "ABC-XYZ" },
  // Add more routes as needed
]
\`\`\`

### Customizing AI Insights

Modify the prompt in \`app/api/generate-insights/route.ts\` to focus on different business aspects:

\`\`\`typescript
const prompt = \`
Your custom analysis prompt here...
Focus on specific metrics or business questions...
\`
\`\`\`

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Error**
   - Ensure your API key is correctly set in \`.env.local\`
   - Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
   - The app provides fallback mock insights if API fails

2. **Charts Not Displaying**
